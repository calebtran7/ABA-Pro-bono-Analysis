# American Bar Association Data Analysis

In this project, we cleaned data from the American Bar Association that outlined client demographics, attorney demographics, real client-lawyer conversations, and attributes of these conversations. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy), R, and Tableau, we performed an EDA on the data sets with a goal of helping ABA improve their system so that attorneys can be better prepared for various types of in-need clients, clients can receive improved services, and interactions between both parties can become more productive overall. 

Below are some of the visualizations with produced, along with the insights we gained from them.

## Word maps
Created word maps using the most common words in the responses.
Excluded out the words of the top 100 words from wikipedia table scraped into a csv
This was done using pandas
Then we sparse through the question results and separate them by each word
Counted up the words and joined this data frame with the questions data frame which enabled us to see which categories each question prompt belonged to
